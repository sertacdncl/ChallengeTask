Controls:  
•Touch/Mouse Input  
•ESC for back to Main menu  

Technologies:  
• Unity Engine 2021.3.30f1  
• Addressables  
• DoTween (3rd Party Plugin)  
• Zenject (3rd Party Plugin)  


Notes:  
I'm still learning Zenject, so i may used somethings wrong. I tried to optimize as much i can for example using Addressables, pooling. I think i can optimize it better in future. I tried to use Future Foldering structure. I also used Assembly Definitions to seperate projects.
